##Elevator Crash!

Hey Rina! So this the main repository for our project, I've added an empty sketch.js file and all the requisite libraries.


I was also rethinking our games flow and I think I've got a good baseline of how to operate the game:

#1. Timer starts up and after a certain number of seconds an elevator light goes off, either going up or down
#2. The player clicks on the elevator, and then the elevator is in one of three states
	A) Open and the player wins the level, yay!
	B) The elevator is occupied, the player has to wait for another elevator
	C) The elevator is broken and the player automatically loses the level
#3. If the player goes through 5 levels consecutively, they win the game!


Those are the basics of it, if there's any major structural revisions let me know!
